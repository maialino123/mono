# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Load the `openspec` skill when the request:

- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

The skill provides:

- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Templates for discovery, proposal, tasks, design, and spec deltas

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.

## Commands

- `bun install` - Install dependencies
- `bun run dev` - Start all apps (server + web)
- `bun run dev:server` - Start server only (Hono on port 3000)
- `bun run dev:web` - Start web only (Next.js on port 3001)
- `bun run check-types` - Typecheck all packages
- `bun run check` - Lint/format with Biome (`biome check --write .`)
- `bun run db:start` - Start PostgreSQL via Docker
- `bun run db:push` - Push schema changes to database
- `bun test <file>` - Run single test file (e.g., `bun test packages/api/src/foo.test.ts`)

## Architecture

- **Monorepo**: Turborepo + Bun workspaces
- **Apps**: `apps/server` (Hono API :3000), `apps/web` (Next.js :3001), `apps/native` (Expo)
- **Packages**: `api` (oRPC routers), `auth` (better-auth), `db` (Drizzle/PostgreSQL), `env` (Zod validation)

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode, ESM modules, Zod for validation
- Biome: 2-space indent, 120 line width, double quotes, auto-organize imports
- Use `catalog:` versions for shared deps in workspace
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.

## Language Requirements

- **English Only:** All artifacts, documentation, comments, and code generated by AI must be in English.
- **Relative Paths Only:** NEVER use absolute paths (e.g., `file:///User/...`) in markdown files or documentation. Use project-relative paths (e.g., `packages/auth/src/index.ts`).
- **Ampcode Links:** If generated documents contain `http://localhost:8317`, replace it with `https://ampcode.com`.

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**

- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
