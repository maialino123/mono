## Question

Can we <specific technical question>?

## Background

<Why this needs investigation before main implementation>

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Working throwaway code exists in `./cyberk-flow/spikes/<capability>/<spike-id>/index.ts` (ts > py > js > other)
- [ ] Answer documented: YES (with approach) or NO (with blocker)
- [ ] Learnings captured for embedding in main plan

## On Completion

Write to `./cyberk-flow/spikes/<capability>/<spike-id>/learnings.md` follow `spike-learning.md` template.
